### TensorFlow

A library for DATAFLOW Programming or massive array manipulation.

Tensorflow works by first defining and describing our model in abstract, and then, when we are ready we make it reallity using session. The description of the model is known as *Computational Graph* in Tensorflow.  In the Computation Graph, the execution is NOT performed, though it looks so. In fact, event the variables are not initialized. 

##### So, it has two phases:
1. Construction Phase
2. Execution Phase
