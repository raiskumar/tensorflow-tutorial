### TensorFlow

A library for DATAFLOW Programming or massive array manipulation.

Tensorflow works by first defining and describing our model in abstract, and then, when we are ready we make it reallity using session. The descripiton of the model is knonw as Computational Graph in Tensorflow.  So, in the computation graph, the execution is NOT performed, though it looks so. In fact, event the variables are not initialized. 

##### So, it has two phases:
1. Construction Phase
2. Execution Phase
